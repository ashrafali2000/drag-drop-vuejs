            Script components allow you to run small JavaScripts to make your prototypes even more interactive. You can for example
            use them to set data binding values, load or send data to a server, or calculate dynamic values, like the sum
            of two input fields.

                       Create a "Grid" elements, which can repeat the child elements.

                    <li>
                        Bind the "Grid" to a "items" data-binding.

                    <li>
                        Bind the text field to a "value" data-binding.

                Now the script is executed when the simulator is launched. It will set the "items" variable to the

                because it is bound to "items". The text fields
                will be bound to the "value". So the first element is bound to "items[0].value", while the second
                is bound to "items[1].value" and so on.

                To execute the script on any input change, select  the trigger "Data Trigger" in the properties.

                When the user changes the value (and after the first load), the script will calculate the sum and set it to the "data" object.
