                    You can import Figma projects into Bawdicsoft by opening the Import wizard. Before you start you need to create an Access key:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Login to your Figma account.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Open the "Account Settings" in the top left menu
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Go to the "personal Access Tokens" section
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on "Create new token"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Copy the generated token, and save it somewhere safe.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    You need to create the token only once, it is valid for all projects in Figma.
                    Once you have a token, perform the following steps:

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Click the menu (<span class="mdi mdi-menu"/>) and select "Import"
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Select the "Figma" tab
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Enter your access key and copy the URL of the Figma project.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Click on "Import"
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                `,
      },
    ],
  },
];
