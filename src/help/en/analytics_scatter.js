                    on the prototype and how many clicks they took.
                    The data is shown as a scatter plot. Each user is presented as a circle in the diagram. 
                    The x-axis represents the time the users spend (duration), and 
                    the y-axis the number of clicks (interactions).

                            The scatter plot gives an instant overview of how the data is distributed. 
                            Often, most testers will use a similar amount of clicks and time. 
                            This will lead to a dense plot area where many of the circles are close 
                            together, which can be easily spotted. If this area is at a different place 
                            than you expected, the design might have some issues, or the task 
                            descriptions need to be more precise.

                        In statistics, outliers are data points very different from most of the data. 
                        Nevertheless, often it is interesting to investigate these data points because they reveal important insights.

                        In the scatter plot, outliers are marked red. These points present users have behaved 
                        differently than the majority of the users. For instance, they take more time, 
                        finish different tasks, or navigate unexpectedly. For the analysis, Bawdicsoft uses 
                        not only the interactions and the duration as inputs but also the following variables:


                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <b>Duration</b>: The total time the user has spent on the test. 
                                A very high or low number might indicate that the user had issues.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Interactions:</b>  The number of clicks and other interactions that the user has done.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Unique Screens:</b> The number of individual screens a user has seen. This metric 
                                quantifies if the user was able to navigate through the design.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Total Screens:</b> The total number of screens a user has visited. This number might 
                                differ from the number of visited screens, for instance, if users go back and forth 
                                between two screens. A significant difference might be a sign that the user had 
                                problems with the navigation.
                            </li>

                                <b>Navigation Anomaly:</b> This metric measures how different a user's navigation patterns 
                                are compared to those of other users. For instance, if all users click 'button 1', 'button 2' 
                                and 'button 3' expect of one user that clicked 'button 3', 'button 2' and 'button 1', that 
                                last user would have a very high score (100) in this metric.

                                <b>Task Success:</b> The number of tasks the user could complete.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
