                        Once the task flow is defined the task list will update and show several KPIs. These KPIs
                        allow you to get a first understanding of whether the testers' behavior is inline with your expectations.

                            <b>Example</b>: You have created a new design for a shopping app, and you 
                            are interested in how the design works. You run some tests and see that
                            the users took an average of 2:30min. This is much more than expected, so you should
                            do a deep dive and check out the detailed statistics to find if there are only some
                            users that have issues and skew the KPIs, or if there is a general problem.

                        The start rate tells you how many users were able to start a given task.

                            <b>Example</b>: Let's assume you have a prototype with three screens. A, B and C. A is wired to B, 
                            and B is wired to C. Also, you have defined a task, that measures if users go from B to C. 
                            If a tester views only screen A, this test session is not counted as started. If the 
                            tester visits A and B, the session is counted as started. 
                        </p>
                        A low start rate indicates that the users have issues navigating in your design. They were not able

                        <div class="MatcHelpExample">
                            <b>Example</b>: We continue with the example outlined above. Let's assume 
                            we have three testers. Tester X visits only
                            A, tester Y visits A and B, and tester Z visits A, B and C. In this case, the 
                            start rate would be 2 / 3, because testers Y and Z managed 
                            to visit screen B. The total number of successes is however only 1 since
                            only tester Z managed to visit screen C. The success rate is thus 1 / 2.

                        In general, you want all users to understand your design and be able to complete
                        the tasks. Hence, the higher the success rate, the better your design.

                        The task duration measures the average / mean time the users take to complete a task.
                        Most of the time short durations indicate that the users understood your design.

                            and 28s. In this case, the mean duration would 
                            be (10 + 12 + 10 + 28) = 60s divided by 4, so 15s.

                        Please be aware that often duration times <b>vary</b> a lot between individual users. As you
                        could see in the example the first three users were quite fast, whereas the last user
                        was slow.
                        <br>
                        It would, in such a case, make sense to review the screen recordings or check the
                        user journey graphs to understand the user's problems.

                        The task interaction measures the average / mean number of interactions
                        the user needs to complete a task.

                        <div class="MatcHelpExample">

                            and 15 clicks. In this case, the mean interaction would 
                            be (5 + 15) = 20 divided by 2, so 10 clicks.
                        </div>

                        Like the duration, the number of interactions may vary a lot between
                        the individual users. The mean value might hide such case outliers,
                        that are interesting for further analysis.

                        make it easy to spot outliers, for instance, a user that took an unusual amount
                        of time and clicks. 

                        <p class="MatcHelpCallout">
